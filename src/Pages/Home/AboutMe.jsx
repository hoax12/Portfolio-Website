          I am a graduate student at University of Southern California-USC specializing in Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. My journey in AI began with a curiosity to understand how machines can think, and it has evolved into hands-on experience in developing and fine-tuning intelligent models.

From creating Named Entity Recognition systems using Bi-LSTM-CRF models to building image-processing software validated by experts, I thrive on transforming abstract ideas into tangible, impactful solutions. My research experiences and academic projects have honed my skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis, while fostering a deep commitment to continuous learning and innovation.
